# game-immersion-translator
A program for translating in game subtitles using a hotkey when playing with language immersion.
My goal is to translate on-screen subtitles when playing games like Persona with Japanese audio and subtitles, by pressing a hotkey for difficult or uknown phrases and sentences. This avoids the hassle of looking up translations manually, while maintaining complete language immersion.
